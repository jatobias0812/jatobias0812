BSIT Student • Aspiring Full-Stack Developer • PSAU

Hi there! 👋 I’m Jan Andrew Tobias, an Information Technology student passionate about building full-stack applications with Python, Django, React, TailwindCSS, and MySQL.

I enjoy creating systems that solve real problems — request portals, authentication modules, academic tools, CRUD apps, and more.
This GitHub serves as my portfolio of projects, achievements, and my journey as a developer.
